# Knapsack_Problem
I have addressed the knapsack problem utilizing both random search and steepest ascent hill climbing algorithms. Following that, I conducted a series of experiments to observe the variations in data as the number of iterations varied. Additionally, I have attached a document named "Sablon_Documentatie" wherein I have documented the resulting data comprehensively.
